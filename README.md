# WeatherApplication


A java Gui based Weather application with good graphics and icons
This application can tell weather of any place in world ..just need to type the location

Though it provides basic information but can be easily scalable to get large information
So anyone can use this project and freely contribute to this project so that next person finds it better position and can contribute it further.

I have used open weather api to get weather json data which I later deserialized to get the desired results . The final results are shown in interactive way using images of different types..icons etc

Though it's basic app but the quality of work that can be done on such kind of applications can be interactive and i done the same .

All the weather icons and png images I have provide under src/weather2 package which you can use accordingly. 

Just Pull or Clone the repository and enjoy working

Enjoy !!
